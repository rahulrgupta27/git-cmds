vmware running with split files-

if you drive size (say 50G) is less than size of storage specified in vmware (say 100G).
if you copy a huge amount of data, or compile a kernel or clone a SDK, then you delete that SDK and clone and compile a new one, 
then inside VM even if total size accumulated (say 30G) is less than drive size (ie 50G), still you might get drive full. bcoz linux doesnt
overwrite the old allocated nodes, unless it reaches near the VM size fullness.

So always make sure you give the size of VM less than actual drive size.
(this I observed on my home old dell laptop)
